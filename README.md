### 🚀Project Overview  

This project focuses on analysing and optimising Streamline Logistics Solutions' order fulfilment process using Excel-based data analytics. The objective was to improve visibility into delivery operations, identify performance bottlenecks, and support better decision-making through an interactive dashboard and demand forecasting. Using historical delivery data, the project transforms raw operational records into actionable insights that help reduce delays, manage backlogs, improve resource allocation, and enhance customer satisfaction.
### ❗Business Problem
Despite implementing modern logistics systems, Streamline Logistics Solutions continued to face operational challenges that impacted performance and profitability. These challenges included increasing order backlogs, delayed deliveries, rising operational costs, and limited real-time visibility into order status. The lack of a centralised performance view made it difficult for decision-makers to understand daily operations, anticipate peak demand, and allocate drivers efficiently. As a result, customer satisfaction declined, and operational costs increased due to overtime and expedited deliveries.
### 🧰Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
- Pivot Tables for aggregation and analysis
- Excel formulas for KPI calculations
- FORECAST.ETS for time series forecasting
- Charts and slicers for dashboard interactivity

### 📈Data Description
The dataset contains delivery-level operational data, including order information, delivery duration, driver identifiers, and order status. The data was cleaned, transformed, and structured to support analysis and reporting.
Key data elements include order timestamps, delivery times in minutes, Delivery performance indicators, driver activity, daily order volume, and backlog indicators. Additional calculated fields were created to support performance measurement and forecasting.

### 💠Key Insights
The analysis revealed several important operational patterns:
- Delivery delays increase on days with high order volume and limited driver availability
- Late deliveries rise significantly during backlog build-up periods
- Driver workload distribution has a direct impact on delivery performance
- Order volume follows a time-based pattern that can be forecasted accurately
- Improved planning based on forecasted demand can reduce operational strain
These insights highlight the need for proactive planning rather than reactive decision-making.

### 🌄Visuals and Outputs
The project delivered an interactive Excel dashboard that includes:
- Daily order volume trend analysis
- Average delivery time tracking
- On Time versus Late delivery performance
- Driver availability and workload overview
- Backlog monitoring
- Forecasted future order volume using time series analysis
The dashboard allows users to filter and explore performance metrics dynamically, enabling faster and more informed decisions.

### 🧾Conclusion and Recommendation
This project demonstrates how Excel-based analytics can be used to solve real-world logistics challenges. By transforming raw delivery data into clear insights, Streamline Logistics Solutions can improve delivery speed, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.

### 📑Key recommendation 
- Improving driver allocation during peak periods.
- Using forecasting to plan resources ahead of demand
- Monitoring delivery status performance daily, and
- Addressing data quality issues to improve tracking accuracy.
- Review zones that deliver slowly
- Distribute driver workload more evenly
- Correct tracking and timestamp gaps
- Monitor backlog and late counts every week

Overall, the project shows the value of data-driven decision-making in improving operational efficiency and sustaining competitive advantage in the logistics industry.
